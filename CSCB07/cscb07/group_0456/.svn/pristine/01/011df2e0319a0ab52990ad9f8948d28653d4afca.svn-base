==== A2 phase I marking ====

Group number: 0456
UTORID usernames of members: lujia34, khanyus7, wuyulu10
Total deductions: 2
Grade: A- -> 84

Your team's Phase II grade is based on this scale:

    https://www.transcripts.utoronto.ca/transcriptguide/
When converting from letter grade to numerical grade, we will use the higher end of the letter grade to convert your mark.
--For example, the higher end of A+ is 100.
--For example, the higher end of A is 89.
.
.
.
In the event that you get a F, your conversion from letter grade to numerical grade will be based on the discretion of the instructor. 

The way we graded is as follows: your team starts with an A+. When errors and
problems are found, you will lose 0, 1, 2, or 3 letter steps, depending on the
severity. As an example, if you lost two steps, your team would earn an A-:

     A+ -> A
     A -> A-

You were asked to follow the Scrum process. A big part of that is to maintain
a product backlog and a sprint backlog.

- [ ]  SB items not broken down into smaller steps -1

TA COMMENTS: Good work!

TA COMMENTS: Good work!

TA COMMENTS: Good work!

==== Testing ==== [up to -6] 
Several steps can be lost for these kinds of issues:

- [ ]  Some testing done for all classes and methods, but not thoroughly up to -3
- [ ]  Test quality is inadequate or tests uninformative -1 to -2
        e.g., testing using lots of print statements instead of assert calls
- [ ]  Code not written to be testable -2

TA COMMENTS: 

==== Correctness ==== [up to -6] (-2 from test cases)

- [ ]  Code doesn't compile without modification (if the fix is simple) -1
- [x]  Code that is complete (from the SB) doesn't work completely: up to -2
- [ ]  Code crashes: -3
- [ ]  Each missing/incomplete feature -1
