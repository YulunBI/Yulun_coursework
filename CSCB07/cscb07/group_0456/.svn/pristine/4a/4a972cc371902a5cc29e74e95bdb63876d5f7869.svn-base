What did I work on in the last three days?
    - implemented popd, pushd (partially)
    - added docs to all commands
    - added methods in FileSystem for use in history, pushd, popd

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - finish implementation of popd, pushd
    - clean up unnecessary/repetitive methods/code structure

Am I blocked on anything?
    - might need cd implemented for popd/pushd
