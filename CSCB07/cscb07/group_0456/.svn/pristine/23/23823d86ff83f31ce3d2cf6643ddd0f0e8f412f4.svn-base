What did I work on in the last three days?
    - implemented history and man
    - added documentation for history and man
    - framework for storing command history in FileSystem
    - brainstormed/discussed with partners how to implement/execute commands/pass information around

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - add documentation for the rest of commands
    - perform some testing on history/man
    - continue ironing out details of command/shell/user interaction

Am I blocked on anything?
    - need other commands created to add documentation
    - need FileSystem/JShell ready to use/test commands properly
