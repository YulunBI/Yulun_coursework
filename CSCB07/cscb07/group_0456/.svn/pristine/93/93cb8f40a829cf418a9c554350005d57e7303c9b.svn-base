What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Finished a working version of SaveJShell and LoadJShell.
    - Finished structure of ClientUrl.

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Improve SaveJShell and LoadJShell.
    - Finish ClientUrl.	

Am I blocked on anything? 
    - Not really, but trying to come up better idea to make FileSystem more secure.
