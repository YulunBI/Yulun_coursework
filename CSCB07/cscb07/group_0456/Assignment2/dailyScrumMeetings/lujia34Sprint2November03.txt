What did I work on in the last three days?
    - implemented popd, pushd
    - cleaned up history, manual (allows for different/various user inputs, fixed order of history)
    - preliminary testing of history, manual

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - testing of commands (esp. pushd/popd)
    - prevent manual from crashing on invalid input (see below)

Am I blocked on anything?
    - need hashtable so history can work off of command names, not class names + avoid errors
