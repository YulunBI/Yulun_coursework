What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Completed crc cards for ClientUrl, SaveJShell, LoadJShell.


What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Finish SaveJShell and LoadJShell(currently trying the approach suggested on Piazza).

Am I blocked on anything? 
    - Not really, just trying to learn serialization and deserialization.
